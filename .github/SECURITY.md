# Security Policy
When I started out **rengine**, I had very little or no knowledge on Django. So I believe there could be many security vulnerabilities.
Please report the security vulnerabilities via Issues Section or email yogesh.ojha11@(gmail).com

The community will be thankful to your contributions. :star:
